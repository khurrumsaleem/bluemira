    Fit a polynomial surface to a 3-D data set.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: np.array(n)
        The x values of the data set
    y: np.array(n)
        The y values of the data set
    z: np.array(n)
        The z values of the data set
    order: int
        The order of the fitting polynomial
    n_grid: int
        The number of gridding points to use on the x and y data

    Returns
    -------
    x2d: np.array(n_grid, n_grid)
        The gridded x data
    y2d: np.array(n_grid, n_grid)
        The gridded y data
    zz: np.array(n_grid, n_grid)
        The gridded z fit data
    coeffs: list
        The list of polynomial coefficents
    r2: float
        The R^2 score of the fit

    Notes
    -----
    The coefficients are ordered by power, and by x and y. For an order = 2
