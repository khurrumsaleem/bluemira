"""
Equilibrium optimisation constraint functions.
for use in NLOpt constrained
optimisation problems.

Constraint functions must be of the form:

.. code-block:: python

    def f_constraint(constraint, x, grad, args):
        constraint[:] = my_constraint_calc(x)
        if grad.size > 0:
            grad[:] = my_gradient_calc(x)
        return constraint

The constraint function convention is such that c <= 0 is sought. I.e. all constraint
values must be negative.

Note that the gradient (Jacobian) of the constraint function is of the form:

.. math::

    \\nabla \\mathbf{c} = \\begin{bmatrix}
            \\dfrac{\\partial c_{0}}{\\partial x_0} & \\dfrac{\\partial c_{0}}{\\partial x_1} & ... \n
            \\dfrac{\\partial c_{1}}{\\partial x_0} & \\dfrac{\\partial c_{1}}{\\partial x_1} & ... \n
            ... & ... & ... \n
            \\end{bmatrix}

The grad and constraint matrices must be assigned in place.

If grad is not updated, the constraint can still be used for derivative-free
optimisaiton algorithms, but will need to be updated or approximated for use
in derivative based algorithms, such as those utilising gradient descent.
