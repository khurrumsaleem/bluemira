        The bluemira parameters for the task. Note that this task does
        not apply any mappings to the ParameterFrame, so they should
        already be set. Most likely by a solver.
    input_file: str
        The path to the plasmod input file.
    output_file: str
        The path to which the plasmod scalar output file should be
        written.
    profiles_file: str
        The path to which the plasmod profiles output file should be
        written.

        The name of, or path to, the plasmod binary. If this is not an
