Coordinate convention
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``Bluemira`` uses a conventional right-handed Cartesian coordinate convention for all geometry.

Occasionally, for certain modules and calculations, a quasi-toroidal coordinate system and a
cylindrical coordinate system are used. Note that to facilitate conversion between the
systems, the radial coordinate in the cylindrical coordinate system is denoted with
:math:`x` and not :math:`r`.

    The three different coordinate systems used in the ``bluemira`` framework: right-handed
    Cartesian coordinate system (:math:`x, y, z`, black), quasi-toroidal coordinate
    system (:math:`r, \theta, \phi`, red), and cylindrical coordinate system
    (:math:`x, \phi, z`, blue).

Tokamaks are largely axisymmetric devices and usually have some form of cyclic symmetry.
In ``bluemira``, by convention, tokamak sectors are numbered :math:`1 .. n`, with the first
sector ranging from :math:`0 .. 360/n_{TF}` degrees, and subsequent sectors in increasing
number, going anti-clockwise as seen from above the machine:

Unit convention
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``Bluemira`` uses the `International System of Units (SI) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units>`_ convention,
with only minor deviations. As a summary, all inputs to the code should be in the following units:
