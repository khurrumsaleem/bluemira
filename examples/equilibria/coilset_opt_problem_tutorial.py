# # OptimisationProblem

# The `OptimisationProblem` class is intended to be the general base class for defining
# optimisation problems across Bluemira.

# It is constructed from the following four objects:
# - `parameterisation`
#     - Object storing data that is updated during the optimisation to be carried out.
# - `optimiser: Optimiser`
#     - `Optimiser` object specifying the numerical algorithm used to optimise an array
#        representing the parameterisation state. Usually based on NLOpt.
# - `objective: OptimisationObjective`
#     - OptimisationObjective object, specifying objective function to be minimised
#       during optimisation.
# - `constraints: List[OptimisationConstraint]`
#     - List of `OptimisationConstraints`, specifying the set of constraints that must
#       be satisfied during the numerical optimisation.


# The goal of the `OptimisationProblem` is to be able to return an optimised
# parameterisation, judged according to the provided objective, subject to
# the set of constraints, using a numerical search algorithm defined in the optimiser.

# Crucially, it provides an `optimise()` method that returns this optimised
# parameterisation. Subclasses may override this `optimise()` method, but must still
# return an optimised parametrisation when `optimise()` is called
# on the OptimisationProblem.

# A `CoilsetOP` is a subclass of `OptimisationProblem`, intended for problems where
# the parameterisation is a `CoilSet` object, which provides some useful additional
# methods for getting and setting coilset state vectors/arrays.

# Subclasses of `CoilsetOP`, such as `BoundedCurrentCOP` or `NestedCoilsetPositionCOP`,
# can be made to bind a `CoilsetOP` to a specific objective function, which is often
# useful for performance reasons where some data in the OptimisationProblem
# does not need to be updated at every iteration.

# # Example
# We will present an example problem where we take an existing `CoilsetOP`subclass,
# `BoundedCurrentCOP`, and apply some additional constraints that
# must be held during the optimisation.
#
# As the objective function for the `BoundedCurrentCOP` OptimisationProblem is already
# specified, we only need to provide the `coilset` (parameterisation), `Optimiser`,
# `OptimisationConstraints`, and any additional arguments that are used in the
# `BoundedCurrentCOP` objective function.

# ### Parametrisation

# We first define the parameterisation to be used in the OptimisationProblem.
# This is just the starting `coilset` in this case.

coil_x = [1.05, 6.85, 6.85, 1.05, 3.2, 5.7, 5.3]
coil_z = [7.85, 4.75, 3.35, 6.0, 8.0, 7.8, 5.50]

        ctype="PF",
    )
    circuit = SymmetricCircuit(coil)
    circuits.append(circuit)
coilset = CoilSet(circuits)

# %%[markdown]

# ### Optimiser

# We next define the `Optimiser` to be used. There is no one-size-fits-all approach
# here, as the best optimiser for a given problem will depend strongly on the
# OptimisationObjective and OptimisationConstraints being applied in the problem.

# `Optimiser` is currently only a wrapper for NLOpt based optimisers, and as such,
# the range of algorithms that may be chosen is determined by those available in
# the NLOpt library. Not all algorithms will work for all objectives - some
# require gradient information, for example - and some require additional parameters.
# Check the NLOpt API documentation for more details.

# Care must also be taken to ensure the termination criteria for the optimisation
# are suitable. Otherwise, the optimisation may never stop running if tolerances
# are too tight, or may stop early and return poorly optimised states if the
# maximum number of evaluations is too low or tolerances are too large.

# %%[markdown]

# ### Additional Parameters

# `BoundedCurrentCOP` requires two additional parameters for generating arguments for
# its `OptimisationObjective` during its `optimise()` call. The `OptimisationObjective`
# figure of merit for `BoundedCurrentCOP` is the regularised least-squares deviation of a
# provided Equilibrium from a set of magnetic field targets (eg. isoflux targets).

# We use a default set of isoflux targets here for this example.

# ### Constraints

# We next define the list of `OptimisationConstraints` to apply.
# In this case, we wish to apply a constraint to prevent solutions where the
# plasma boundary at the inboard midplane of the plasma is prevented from moving
# inside a provided radius.

# We will use `bluemira.equilibria.opt_constraints.current_midplane_constraint`
# as our constraint function here to do this.

# ```python
# def current_midplane_constraint(
#     constraint, vector, grad, opt_problem, radius, inboard=True
# ):
#     """
#     Constraint function to constrain the inboard or outboard midplane
#     of the plasma during optimisation.

#     Parameters
#     ----------
#     radius: float
#         Toroidal radius at which to constrain the plasma midplane.
#     inboard: bool (default=True)
#         Boolean controlling whether to constrain the inboard (if True) or
#         outboard (if False) side of the plasma midplane.
#     """
#     coilset_state = np.concatenate((opt_problem.x0, opt_problem.z0, vector))

#     lcfs = opt_problem.eq.get_LCFS()
#     if inboard:
#         constraint[:] = radius - min(lcfs.x)
#     else:
#         constraint[:] = max(lcfs.x) - radius
#     return constraint
# ```

# The first three arguments here are expected by NLOpt, and must always be present in
# constraint functions.
# - constraint
#     - np.array storing constraint information. During the optimisation,
#       `constraint[:]<=0` is considered to represent the constraint being satisfied,
#       and `constraint[:]>0` represents the constraint being violated.
# - vector
#     - np.array representing the state vector that is optimised during the
#       numerical optimisation.
# - grad
#     - np.array representing Jacobian for the constraint function. This must always
#       be present in the arguments, but only needs to be calculated if the `Optimiser`
#       is employing an algorithm that requires derivative information.

# The fourth, `opt_problem`, is optional, and provides an interface to the
# `OptimisationProblem` the constraint is applied to. This may be useful for performance
# reasons, where data needed by the `constraint` does not need to be updated every
# iteration of the optimisation. Where possible, explicit arguments should be provided to
# the `OptimisationProblem`, however.

# The remaining arguments are explicit arguments that can be passed to the constraint to
# control its behaviour.

# This constraint function can be passed to a `OptimisationConstraint` object, along with
# explicit arguments, constraint tolerances, and constraint type, that is used by
# NLOpt when applying the constraint.

# User specified constraints can be supplied here, if so desired.
