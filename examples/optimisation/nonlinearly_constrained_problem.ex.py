"""Non-linearly constrained optimisation problem"""

# %%[markdown]
# Let's solve the nonlinearly constrained minimization problem:
#
# $$ \min_{x \in \R^2} \sqrt{x_2} \tag{1}$$
#
# subject to
#
# $$ x_2 \ge 0 \tag{2} $$
# $$x_2 \ge (a_1x_1 + b_1)^3 \tag{3} $$
# $$ x_2 \ge (a_2 x_1 + b_2)^3 \tag{4} $$
#
# for parameters $a_1 = 2$, $b_1 = 0$, $a_2 = -1$, $b_2 = 1$.
#
# This example problem is ripped straight from the
# [NLOpt docs](https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/NLopt_Tutorial/#example-nonlinearly-constrained-problem).
#
# This problem expects a minimum at $ x = ( \frac{1}{3}, \frac{8}{27} ) $.
