Welcome to naughty geometry. If you've come here, it's probably because you've experienced a failure in a CAD operation.

This folder stores failed geometry operations such that the inputs can be inspected and the failure better understood.

Please do take a moment to load up the geometry(-ies) that was/were input to the function and see if they are valid.

If you believe they are valid, please submit a bug report with the relevant file(s) and we will see if there is
anything we can do about it.
